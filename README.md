# PMID-32832598-lung-endothelial-cells
Extracting the endothelial cells from the PMID 32832598 lung single cell dataset.

This is done using the standard Seurat workflow (Stuart et al., 2019). To filter out endothelial cells, a list of endothelial markers was used (CLDN5, VWF, FLT1, PECAM1) as an input for SCINA (Zhang et al., 2019). A total of 4103 cells were identified as being endothelial.
